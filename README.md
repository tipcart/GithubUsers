# GitHubUsers
GitHubUsers is an app, which displays simply list of GitHub users with avatars.
The main idea is to write it in Kotlin, use MVVM architectural pattern, Kotlin Coroutines and Live Data.

## GitHub
[Github](https://github.com/about) is an online code collaboration platform, which exposes [REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

## Getting list of users
GitHub's API documentation to fetch users is located here: https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-all-users
and the API here: https://api.github.com/users

For each user, there's an avatar URL among many other information available.
